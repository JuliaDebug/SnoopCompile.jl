"""
    tinf = @snoopi_deep commands

Produce a profile of julia's type inference, recording the amount of time spent inferring
every `MethodInstance` processed while executing `commands`. Each fresh entrance to
type inference (whether executed directly in `commands` or because a call was made
by runtime-dispatch) also collects a backtrace so the caller can be identified.

`tinf` is a tree, each node containing data on a particular inference "frame" (the method,
argument-type specializations, parameters, and even any constant-propagated values).
Each reports the [`exclusive`](@ref)/[`inclusive`](@ref) times, where the exclusive
time corresponds to the time spent inferring this frame in and of itself, whereas
the inclusive time includes the time needed to infer all the callees of this frame.

The top-level node in this profile tree is `ROOT`. Uniquely, its exclusive time
corresponds to the time spent _not_ in julia's type inference (codegen, llvm_opt, runtime, etc).

There are many different ways of inspecting and using the data stored in `tinf`.
The simplest is to load the `AbstracTrees` package and display the tree with
`AbstractTrees.print_tree(tinf)`.
See also:  `flamegraph`, `flatten`, `inference_triggers`, `SnoopCompile.parcel`,
`runtime_inferencetime`.
