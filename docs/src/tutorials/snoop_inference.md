# Tutorial on `@snoop_inference`

Inference may occur when you *run* code. Inference is the first step of *type-specialized* compilation. `@snoop_inference` collects data on what inference is doing, giving you greater insight into what is being inferred and how long it takes.

Compilation is needed only for "fresh" code; running the demos below on code you've already used will yield misleading results. When analyzing inference, you're advised to always start from a fresh session. See also the [comparison between SnoopCompile and JET](@ref JET).

### Add SnoopCompileCore, SnoopCompile, and helper packages to your environment

Here, we'll add these packages to your [default environment](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/). (With the exception of `AbstractTrees`, these "developer tool" packages should not be added to the Project file of any real packages unless you're extending the tool itself.)

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["SnoopCompileCore", "SnoopCompile", "AbstractTrees", "ProfileView"]);
```

## Setting up the demo

To see `@snoop_inference` in action, we'll use the following demo:

```jldoctest flatten-demo; filter=r"Main\.var\"Main\"\."
module FlattenDemo
    struct MyType{T} x::T end

    extract(y::MyType) = y.x

    function domath(x)
        y = x + x
        return y*x + 2*x + 5
    end

    dostuff(y) = domath(extract(y))

    function packintype(x)
        y = MyType{Int}(x)
        return dostuff(y)
    end
end

# output

FlattenDemo
```

The main call, `packintype`, stores the input in a `struct`, and then calls functions that extract the field value and performs arithmetic on the result.

## [Collecting the data](@id sccshow)

To profile inference on this call, do the following:

```jldoctest flatten-demo; filter=r"([0-9]*\.?[0-9]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?|WARNING: replacing module FlattenDemo\.\n)"
julia> using SnoopCompileCore

julia> tinf = @snoop_inference FlattenDemo.packintype(1);

julia> using SnoopCompile

julia> tinf
InferenceTimingNode: 0.002712/0.003278 on Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT() with 1 direct children
```

!!! tip
    Don't omit the semicolon on the `tinf = @snoop_inference ...` line, or you may get an enormous amount of output. The compact display on the final line is possible only because `SnoopCompile` defines nice `Base.show` methods for the data returned by `@snoop_inference`. These methods cannot be defined in `SnoopCompileCore` because it has a fundamental design constraint: loading `SnoopCompileCore` is not allowed to invalidate any code. Moving those `Base.show` methods to `SnoopCompileCore` would violate that guarantee.

This may not look like much, but there's a wealth of information hidden inside `tinf`.

## A quick check for potential invalidations

After running `@snoop_inference`, it's generally recommended to check the output of [`staleinstances`](@ref):
```julia
julia> staleinstances(tinf)
SnoopCompileCore.InferenceTiming[]
```

If you see this, all's well.
A non-empty list might indicate method invalidations, which can be checked (in a fresh session) using the tools described in [Tutorial on `@snoop_invalidations`](@ref).

If you do have a lot of invalidations, [`precompile_blockers`](@ref) may be an effective way to reveal those invalidations that affect your particular package and workload.

## [Viewing the results](@id flamegraph)

Let's start unpacking the output of `@snoop_inference` and see how to get more insight.
First, notice that the output is an `InferenceTimingNode`: it's the root element of a tree of such nodes, all connected by caller-callee relationships.
Indeed, this particular node is for `Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT()`, a "dummy" node that is the root of all such trees.

You may have noticed that this `ROOT` node prints with two numbers.
It will be easier to understand their meaning if we first display the whole tree.
We can do that with the [AbstractTrees](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AbstractTrees.jl) package:

```jldoctest flatten-demo; filter=[r"[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?", r"Main\.var\"Main\"\."]
julia> using AbstractTrees

julia> print_tree(tinf)
InferenceTimingNode: 0.002712/0.003278 on Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT() with 1 direct children
└─ InferenceTimingNode: 0.000133/0.000566 on FlattenDemo.packintype(::Int64) with 2 direct children
   ├─ InferenceTimingNode: 0.000094/0.000094 on FlattenDemo.MyType{Int64}(::Int64) with 0 direct children
   └─ InferenceTimingNode: 0.000089/0.000339 on FlattenDemo.dostuff(::FlattenDemo.MyType{Int64}) with 2 direct children
      ├─ InferenceTimingNode: 0.000064/0.000122 on FlattenDemo.extract(::FlattenDemo.MyType{Int64}) with 2 direct children
      │  ├─ InferenceTimingNode: 0.000034/0.000034 on getproperty(::FlattenDemo.MyType{Int64}, ::Symbol) with 0 direct children
      │  └─ InferenceTimingNode: 0.000024/0.000024 on getproperty(::FlattenDemo.MyType{Int64}, x::Symbol) with 0 direct children
      └─ InferenceTimingNode: 0.000127/0.000127 on FlattenDemo.domath(::Int64) with 0 direct children
```

This tree structure reveals the caller-callee relationships, showing the specific types that were used for each `MethodInstance`.
Indeed, as the calls to `getproperty` reveal, it goes beyond the types and even shows the results of [constant propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding);
the `getproperty(::MyType{Int64}, x::Symbol)` corresponds to `y.x` in the definition of `extract`.

!!! note
    Generally we speak of [call graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) rather than call trees.
    But because inference results are cached (a.k.a., we only "visit" each node once), we obtain a tree as a depth-first-search of the full call graph.

You can extract the `MethodInstance` with

```jldoctest flatten-demo
julia> Core.MethodInstance(tinf)
MethodInstance for Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT()

julia> Core.MethodInstance(tinf.children[1])
MethodInstance for FlattenDemo.packintype(::Int64)
```

Each node in this tree is accompanied by a pair of numbers.
The first number is the *exclusive* inference time (in seconds), meaning the time spent inferring the particular `MethodInstance`, not including the time spent inferring its callees.
The second number is the *inclusive* time, which is the exclusive time plus the time spent on the callees.
Therefore, the inclusive time is always at least as large as the exclusive time.

The `ROOT` node is a bit different: its exclusive time measures the time spent on all operations *except* inference.
In this case, we see that the entire call took approximately 10ms, of which 9.3ms was spent on activities besides inference.
Almost all of that was code-generation, but it also includes the time needed to run the code.
Just 0.76ms was needed to run type-inference on this entire series of calls.
As you will quickly discover, inference takes much more time on more complicated code.

We can also display this tree as a flame graph, using the [ProfileView.jl](https://github.com/timholy/ProfileView.jl) package:

```jldoctest flatten-demo; filter=r":\d+"
julia> fg = flamegraph(tinf)
Node(FlameGraphs.NodeData(ROOT() at typeinfer.jl:75, 0x00, 0:10080857))
```

```julia
julia> using ProfileView

julia> ProfileView.view(fg)
```

You should see something like this:

![flamegraph](../assets/flamegraph-flatten-demo.png)

Users are encouraged to read the ProfileView documentation to understand how to interpret this, but briefly:

- the horizontal axis is time (wide boxes take longer than narrow ones), the vertical axis is call depth
- hovering over a box displays the method that was inferred
- left-clicking on a box causes the full `MethodInstance` to be printed in your REPL session
- right-clicking on a box opens the corresponding method in your editor
- ctrl-click can be used to zoom in
- empty horizontal spaces correspond to activities other than type-inference
- any boxes colored red (there are none in this particular example, but you'll see some later) correspond to *naively non-precompilable* `MethodInstance`s, in which the method is owned by one module but the types are from another unrelated module. Such `MethodInstance`s are omitted from the precompile cache file unless they've been "marked" by `PrecompileTools.@compile_workload` or an explicit `precompile` directive.
- any boxes colored orange-yellow (there is one in this demo) correspond to methods inferred for specific constants (constant propagation)

You can explore this flamegraph and compare it to the output from `print_tree`.

Finally, [`flatten`](@ref), on its own or together with [`accumulate_by_source`](@ref), allows you to get an sense for the cost of individual `MethodInstance`s or `Method`s.

The tools here allow you to get an overview of where inference is spending its time.
This gives you insight into the major contributors to latency.
